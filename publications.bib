abstract = {Background
A higher prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and autistic traits among transgender and gender diverse individuals compared to the general population has been reported. However, inconsistent findings and methodological limitations have been noted in the literature. This study aims to investigate the prevalence of ASD diagnoses and autistic traits among individuals with gender dysphoria compared to a cisgender group and to explore associations between autism and self-reported levels of gender incongruence in individuals with gender dysphoria.
Methods
This study is part of the Swedish Gender Dysphoria Study. ASD diagnoses were retrieved from the national patient registers. Autistic traits were assessed using the Ritvo Autism and Asperger Diagnostic Scale-14 (RAADS-14) and Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ). Gender incongruence was evaluated with the Transgender Congruence Scale. Associations with gender incongruence were examined with linear regression analysis.
Results
Participants with gender dysphoria, regardless of birth-assigned sex, had a higher prevalence of ASD compared with cisgender participants (RR = 7.8; 95 % CI = 3.9, 15.3). The gender dysphoria group also scored higher on both the RAADS-14 (MD = 8.0; 95 % CI = 6.6, 9.6) and AQ (MD = 5.3; 95 % CI = 4.0, 6.6). When stratified by birth-assigned sex, the prevalence of ASD did not differ among participants with gender dysphoria. No association was found between ASD and gender incongruence among individuals with gender dysphoria.
Conclusions
Our findings confirm the high co-occurrence of ASD and gender dysphoria and suggest no difference in gender incongruence between autistic and non-autistic people with gender dysphoria.},

	abstract = {Introduction There has been a drastic increase in the reported number of people seeking help for gender dysphoria in many countries over the last two decades. Yet, our knowledge of gender dysphoria and related outcomes is restricted due to the lack of high-quality studies employing comprehensive approaches. This longitudinal study aims to enhance our knowledge of gender dysphoria; different aspects will be scrutinised, focusing primarily on the psychosocial and mental health outcomes, prognostic markers and, secondarily, on the underlying mechanisms for its origin.Methods and analysis The Swedish Gender Dysphoria Study is an ongoing multicentre longitudinal cohort study with 501 registered participants with gender dysphoria who are 15 years old or older. Participants at different phases of their clinical evaluation process can enter the study, and the expected follow-up duration is three years. The study also includes a comparison group of 458 age- and county-matched individuals without gender dysphoria. Data on the core outcomes of the study, which are gender incongruence and experienced gender dysphoria, body satisfaction and satisfaction with gender-affirming treatments, as well as other relevant outcomes, including mental health, social functioning and life satisfaction, are collected via web surveys. Two different research visits, before and after starting on gender-affirming hormonal treatment (if applicable), are planned to collect respective biological and cognitive measures. Data analysis will be performed using appropriate biostatistical methods. A power analysis showed that the current sample size is big enough to analyse continuous and categorical outcomes, and participant recruitment will continue until December 2022.Ethics and dissemination The ethical permission for this study was obtained from the Local Ethical Review Board in Uppsala, Sweden. Results of the study will be presented at national and international conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals. Dissemination will also be implemented through the Swedish Gender Dysphoria Study network in Sweden.},
